practical implementation of the libCEED library.

## Finite Element Operator Decomposition

Finite element operators are typically defined through weak formulations of
partial differential equations, that involve integration over a computational
mesh.



Any finite element operator that is mapped on a parallel machine can be
decomposed in components that identify the
