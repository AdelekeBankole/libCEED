# Examples

This section contains a mathematical description of all examples provided with libCEED
in the {file}`examples/` directory.
These examples are meant to demonstrate use of libCEED from standalone definition of operators to integration with external libraries such as [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release), [MFEM](https://mfem.org), and [Nek5000](https://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/), as well as more substantial mini-apps.
