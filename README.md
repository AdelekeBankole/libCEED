# The CEEP API Library: Code for Efficient Extensible Discretization

This repository contains...

The repository is part of the [CEED software
suite](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/software/), a collection of software
benchmarks, miniapps, libraries and APIs for efficient exascale discretizations
based on high-order finite element and spectral element methods.  See
http://github.com/ceed for more information and source code availability.

The CEED research is supported by the [Exascale Computing Project](https://exascaleproject.org/exascale-computing-project)
(17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy
organizations (Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security
Administration) responsible for the planning and preparation of a
[capable exascale ecosystem](https://exascaleproject.org/what-is-exascale),
including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering and early
testbed platforms, in support of the nationâ€™s exascale computing imperative.

## Building

The CEED library, `libceed`, is a C99 library that can be built using

    make

## Testing

The test suite produces [TAP](https://testanything.org) output and is
run by:

    make test
